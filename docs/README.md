**Vale** is a cross-platform \(macOS, Windows, and Linux\), command-line linter for prose built with speed and extensibility in mind.

Unlike most writing-related software, Vale's primary purpose isn't to provide its own advice; it's designed to enforce an existing style guide through its YAML-based [extension system](https://errata-ai.github.io/vale/styles).

No matter if you're working with a small in-house standard or a large editorial style guide, Vale will help you maintain consistent and error-free writing.
