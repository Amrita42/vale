## About

**Vale** is a free, open-source linter for prose built with speed and extensibility in mind.

Unlike most writing aids, Vale's primary purpose isn't to provide its own advice; it's designed to
enforce an existing style guide through its easy-to-use [extension system](/vale/styles).

No matter if you're working with a small in-house standard or a large editorial style guide, Vale
will help you maintain consistent and error-free writing.
