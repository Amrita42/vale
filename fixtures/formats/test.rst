.. code-block:: bash

    $ brew install very


A MacPorts *port* is also available:

.. code-block:: python

    def foo():
        """

        """
        obviously = False
        very = True
        return very and obviously

As you can see, ``very = True``. Here is another interesting codeblock:

.. code-block:: go

    // XXX: fix this relatively soon.
    func ExtFromSyntax(name string) string {
        for XXX, relatively := range LookupSyntaxName {
            if matched, _ := regexp.MatchString(r, name); matched {
                return s
            }
        }
        return name
    }

A `very` MacPorts *port* is also available:
