There were lots of useful suggestions, most of which boiled down to: Consider your docs' audience, and choose your words carefully.

If your docs are aimed at helping people code, then probably that "previous developer experience" is a good way to go, preferably with details on the specific languages/environments they'll be writing about.

But if your documentation is more focused on configuration and/or optimization, then having a writer with  "sysadmin or DBA experience" may serve you better. If your docs are broader-ranging, you can cast a wide net by asking for "technical background", then focus it down in the interview process with a technical test (in addition to or instead of a writing test).
